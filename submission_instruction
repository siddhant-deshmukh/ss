Submission instructions

Rename all your python scripts with a prefix <SS_team_id>, for example the script name is aruco_detection.py and your team id is 1234, then rename the file as SS_1234_aruco_detection.py. Make sure you make changes everywhere in the code where you are including the files.

Also upload the video of the bonus task on youtube as unlisted with name <SS_team_id>_Task1_bonus. Submit the link of that youtube video in a text file named <SS_team_id>_video.txt

Compress the python script along with the text file and result images directly to a zip file and name it with the file name <SS_team_id>.zip, for eg. SS_1234.zip

Overall, your directory should look like this

 __SS_1234.zip   
      |__SS_1234_aruco_detection.py
      |__SS_1234_aruco_detection_bonus.py
      |__SS_1234_aruco_library.py
      |__Result_image1.png
      |__Result_image2.png
      |__SS_1234_video.txt

Submit the zip file containing solution of task 1 as well as the bonus task on the portal
